The __Fibonacci__ sequence is named after Italian mathematician [Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number "Fibonacci"). 
His *1202 book Liber Abaci* introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics, although the sequence had been described earlier in Indian mathematics.

The Fibonacci numbers or sequence is: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144…

Each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. In mathematical terms: 

+ Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2 where F0=0,F1=1

Fibonacci numbers can be computed in several different ways. The following solution calculates each fibonacci number in sequence:
